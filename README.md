## About
Facebook [Lexical framework](https://github.com/facebook/lexical) allows you to build powerful text editors (Notion.so is a great example).  While I find the framework a bit easier to work with than [Slate.js](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate), it still requires a lot of bolierplate to implement a basic plain text editor.  This repo contains a few "recipes" that I may need in future projects.

Live demo:  https://lexical-examples.vercel.app/

### How to build the project

The project is a standard Next.js app

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
